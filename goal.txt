Since my time working on this project is limited to my spare time after work,
let's introduce some organization.

My hopes for this library are as follows:
1) Creating a fast, intuitive, and flexible tool that'll find dates in natural
language text.
2) Flexibility is key. Not just in how things are parsed, but in how the library
itself is meant to be used. The library will not be an expansive one, but instead
is meant to help improve the code of others.
2.a) This flexibility will be manifest primarily in what's allowed/expected
to be passed in, and in what's eventually spit out.

Example usage:
parse("There are some dates in this text....") -> [list of probable dates]
parse("There are some dates in this text", released=SOME_DATE)
-> [list of probable dates given that this block of text was sent on SOME_DATE]
